Description
The controller.py script is responsible for controlling various devices connected to the Arduino board using the PyFirmata library. It provides functions and methods to interact with different components such as LEDs, sensors, and actuators.

The main.py script serves as the main entry point for the project. It demonstrates how to utilize the controller.py module to control the connected devices based on specific conditions or events.

Requirements
Python (3.x)
PyFirmata library
Arduino board with Firmata firmware
5 Led

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine
Set up the Arduino board with Firmata firmware by following the instructions provided by the Arduino documentation.
Install the necessary dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
Open the Arduino IDE and upload the Firmata sketch to the Arduino board.
Modify the main.py script as per your specific requirements.
Run the main.py script: python main.py
The controller.py module will communicate with the Arduino board, allowing you to control the connected devices.
